# Atomica Theme

This is a slightly tweaked VS Code Theme, based on: [vscode-theme-onedark](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onedark). 

## Installation
Since this theme is not (yet) on the VS Code marketplace, you need to install it manually.
To do so `cd` into you extension folder. Often found at: `~/.vscode/extensions` and clone this repo: `
https://github.com/systeno/atomica.git`.
