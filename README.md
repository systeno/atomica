# Atomica Theme

This is a slightly tweaked VS Code Theme, based on: [vscode-theme-onedark](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onedark). 
It is still under construction and will most likey get some drastic changes.

## Installation
Since this theme is not (yet) on the VS Code marketplace, you need to install it manually.
To do so `cd` into your extension folder. Often found under: `~/.vscode/extension` and clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/systeno/atomica.git`. 


## Settings
I am creating this while using my own settings. This include some custom css. This may cause it to look differently with other settings.
My settings can be found at: [https://github.com/systeno/vscode-settings](https://github.com/systeno/vscode-settings).
